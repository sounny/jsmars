# Work Log

This log captures the reasoning and actions taken while expanding the agent guidance and sketching plans for turning JMARS into JSMARS.

## 2025-11-21 Session Notes
- Reviewed the existing agent brief (then named `AGNETS.md`) to understand project intent and scope.
- Renamed the briefing to `AGENTS.md` for clarity and expanded it with architecture details, coding conventions, and near-term milestones.
- Established a `/docs` directory to hold planning materials and ongoing logs.
- Authored the initial roadmap and transition plan to outline how the JS client should grow toward JMARS parity.
- Documented this session to keep future contributors aware of decisions and next steps.
